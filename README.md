   Super Air Hockey was my third year project at university. I was tasked with creating an IOS version of an existing game on Windows. We also had to implement many new features, such as a map editing mode which was playable online with other IOS users and also Windows clients. This was a big project considering we had to support cross-platform play and me and my partner had never done any IOS programming beforehand. The end result was a very playable app packed with features.
